Residual networks are famed for receiving first place in latest ILSVRC image classification.

They are able to achieve a start of the art performance in image classification tasks beating previous VGG net Stochastic Depth is a ridiculously simple idea which can help in training the network even if the maximum depth is in order of 1000s.(http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09382v2.pdf). Explanation for the code is available at http://pradyu1993.github.io/2016/06/06/resnet-post.html.
